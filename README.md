# RPCC Mailing Room Optimization

**Main Questions and Approaches:**
This project started in response to the long wait times first year students encountered at the RPCC mail pickup center. In context of that, our primary goal was to identify aspects of the campus mail distribution process that could be optimized to ultimately shorten waiting times. In pursuing this question, our approach was to maximize our understanding and relevant observations of the campus mail distribution process specific to Cornell, and apply relevant knowledge from statistics and optimization/operations research literature for useful insights on the data and practical solutions we could implement. We obtained these observations by sending groups of members of the student teams to RPCC to record the experiences of the employees working at the service desk, and again to collect data of students who came to collect packages based on the variables we identified as important in understanding the process.
